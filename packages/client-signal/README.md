# @polkadot/client-signal

A WebRTC signalling server & cleint that is compatible with [libp2p-webrtc-star](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-webrtc-star)

Inspired by the signalling server above, re-written in TypeScript with Koa. Additionally, the client has also been adpated, supporting re-connections instead of ailing outright.
