# @polkadot/client

A very early, WIP and POC JavaScript version of a simplified Polkadot network client. It is incomplete and may not evolve to be a full-featured client.

It is split up into a number of internal packages -

- [packages/client](packages/client/) The main JavaScript client
- [packages/client-db](packages/client-db/) Database interface
- [packages/client-p2p](packages/client-p2p/) Peer-to-peer server
- [packages/client-rpc](packages/client-rpc/) RPC server
- [packages/client-wasm](packages/client-wasm/) Wasm interface wrapper

## Local development node

Start the node with `yarn run start <options>`. User `--help` to get a list of available options.

It is possible to start 2 servers (testing connections between), by opening 2 terminals, starting normally in the first and in the second running `yarn run start2`.

The above is (currently) equivalent to offsetting the ports by 1 and adding the first as a peer. The equivalent command would be -

```
$ yarn run start --p2p-peers=/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/39933 --p2p-port=39934 --rpc-port=9934 --db-path=./tmp
```
